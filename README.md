To set up a Jupyter Notebook, ssh to the t3 and use the command: `jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8080`

This will initialize a notebook in your current directory (and containing any other directories - so doing it in the main one may be most useful).

Then you can go to http://t3.unl.edu:8080/ in your web browser to access the notebook.
